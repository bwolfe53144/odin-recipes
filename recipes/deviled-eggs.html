    <h3 class="recipe">Description</h3>
    <p>Deviled eggs are a favorite for any holiday meal, 
        potluck, or party. If you're looking for a classic, no-frills 
        deviled eggs recipe this is it.</p>  
    <p>The filling for Southern-style deviled eggs is nothing more 
        than egg yolks, mayonnaise (Duke's if you can find it), mustard, 
        and sweet pickle relish. Use a fork to mash these ingredients 
        together until the filling is completely smooth. Spoon the filling 
        into the halved egg whites, or pipe in the yolk mixture for a pretty, 
        swirled topping.</p>
    <p>Learn how to make deviled eggs, and watch them fly off the platter as 
        guests gobble them up.</p>
